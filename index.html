                <p>Public awareness around Colony Collapse Disorder has increased drastically over the past 
                    several years along with the rate at which these colonies are dying. This serious disorder
                     is caused by a slew of complex environmental factors but societal changes and public
                      programs that support bee populations across America are helping to combat this 
                      phenomenon. On January 1, 2019 Honey Bee colonies for operations numbering 5 or more
                    were up 1% from the previous year but it is unclear if this is the start of a true recovery 
                    or a happy but temporary uptick. As of July 2019, quarterly data collection by y the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)
                    has been suspended due to a lack of budget. I have elected to analyze some of the data made public in
                 their final quarter of operation and make digestable the raw numbers.</p>

                    The map above illustrates the American States and their corresponding 
                    rates of Honey Bee Colonies lost from January to March calculated as a percentage out of 
                    the initial number of colonies alive on January first. Darker colors indicate a higher
                    rate of colonies lost to colony collapse disorder. Those which are pale white and do not have numbers 
                    listed in the window which appears when you hover over, are states which the government 
                    was unable to collect data for.

                        between their number of colonies at the beginning of the quarter and their maximum 
                        number of hives at any given point in the quarter. This chart is not calculated by

                        This chart contextualizes the percentage of colonies lost in a state out of their initial number of colonies 
                        to the similarly calculated percentage of colonies added. These ten states had the greatest difference 
                        between these percentages. Since all states did lose more colonies than could be added, I have here 
                        displayed the most drastic instances of these phenomenon. For the United States in its entirety, 407700 
                        colonies were lost to colony collapse disorder and 247710 were added.
